## What's going on?

This is really just a chance to play around with a few different libraries that I'd like a bit more familiarity with such as:

- [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) - Primitive and flexible state management for React using atoms, inspired by recoil
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
